    "Measurement of knee alignment is useful for diagnosis of arthritic conditions and for planning and evaluation of surgical interventions. Alignment is measured by the hip-knee-ankle ($HKA$) angle in standing, load bearing, x-ray images. The angle is defined by the femoral and tibial mechanical axes. The femoral axis is defined by the center of the femur head and the mid condylar point. The tibial axis is defined by the center of the tibial plateau to the center of the tibial plafond. \n",
