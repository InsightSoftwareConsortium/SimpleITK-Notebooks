    "# Trust but Verify - Inspection of Large Image Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook and accompanying [Python script](characterize_data.py) illustrate the use of SimpleITK as a tool for efficient data inspection on large image collections, as part of familiarizing oneself with the data and performing cleanup prior to its use in deep learning or any other supervised machine learning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for inspecting your data before using it include:\n",
    "1. Identification of corrupt images.\n",
    "2. Identification of erroneous images (label noise).\n",
    "3. Assessment of data quality and variability in terms of intensity range, image resolution, and pixel types.\n",
    "4. Reduction of workload, identifying redundant information content (e.g. a greyscale/single channel image masquerading as a color/three channel image - think x-ray in jpg file).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We inspect our data in two ways:\n",
    "1. Summary of image characteristics found in a directory structure (generic and DICOM specific).\n",
    "2. Visual inspection of the image content.\n",
    "\n",
    "SimpleITK allows us to easily control for the image types we are interested in via the ImageIO. The currently supported/registered IO types are defined by the following strings:\n",
    "* 'BMPImageIO'\n",
    "* 'BioRadImageIO'\n",
