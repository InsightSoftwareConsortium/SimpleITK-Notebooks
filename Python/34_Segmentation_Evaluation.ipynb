    "# Segmentation Evaluation <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/InsightSoftwareConsortium/SimpleITK-Notebooks/master?filepath=Python%2F34_Segmentation_Evaluation.ipynb\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg\"></a>\n",

    "Evaluating segmentation algorithms is most often done using reference data to which you compare your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the medical domain reference data is commonly obtained via manual segmentation by an expert (don't forget to thank your clinical colleagues for their hard work). When you are resource limited, the reference data may be defined by a single expert. This is less than ideal. When multiple experts provide you with their input then you can potentially combine them to obtain reference data that is closer to the ever elusive \"ground truth\". In this notebook we show two approaches to combining input from multiple observers, majority vote and the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level\n",
    "Estimation [(STAPLE)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15250643).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a reference, we compare the algorithm's performance using multiple criteria, as usually there is no single evaluation measure that conveys all of the relevant information. In this notebook we illustrate the use of the following evaluation criteria:\n",
    "* Overlap measures:\n",
    "  * Jaccard and Dice coefficients \n",
    "  * false negative and false positive errors\n",
    "* Surface distance measures:\n",
    "  * Hausdorff distance (symmetric)\n",
    "  * mean, median, max and standard deviation between surfaces\n",
    "* Volume measures:\n",
    "  * volume similarity $ \\frac{2*(v1-v2)}{v1+v2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant criteria are task dependent, so you need to ask yourself whether you are interested in detecting spurious errors or not (mean or max surface distance), whether over/under segmentation should be differentiated (volume similarity and Dice or just Dice), and what is the ratio between acceptable errors and the size of the segmented object (Dice coefficient may be too sensitive to small errors when the segmented object is small and not sensitive enough to large errors when the segmented object is large).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we use in the notebook is a set of manually segmented liver tumors from a single clinical CT scan. The relevant publication is: T. Popa et al., \"Tumor Volume Measurement and Volume Measurement Comparison Plug-ins for VolView Using ITK\", SPIE Medical Imaging: Visualization, Image-Guided Procedures, and Display, 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The approach described here can also be used to evaluate Registration, as illustrated in the [free form deformation notebook](65_Registration_FFD.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended read**: A community effort describing limitations of various evaluation metrics, \n",
