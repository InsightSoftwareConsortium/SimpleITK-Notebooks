    "Registration is defined as the estimation of a geometric transformation aligning objects such that the distance between corresponding points on these objects is minimized, bringing the objects into alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with point-based registration algorithms we have three types of errors associated with our points (originally defined in [1]):  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fiducial Localization Error (FLE)**: The error in determining the location of a point which is used to estimate the transformation. The most widely used FLE model is that of a zero mean Gaussian with independent, identically distributed errors. The figure below illustrates the various possible fiducial localization errors:\n",

    "<img src=\"fle.svg\" style=\"width:600px\"/><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fiducial Registration Error (FRE)**: The error of the fiducial markers following registration, $\\|T(\\mathbf{p_f}) - \\mathbf{p_m}\\|$ where $T$ is the estimated transformation and the points $\\mathbf{p_f},\\;\\mathbf{p_m}$ were used to estimate $T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Registration Error (TRE)**: The error of the target fiducial markers following registration,$\\|T(\\mathbf{p_f}) - \\mathbf{p_m}\\|$ where $T$ is the estimated transformation and the points $\\mathbf{p_f},\\;\\mathbf{p_m}$ were **not** used to estimate $T$. \n",

    "Things to remember:\n",
    "1. TRE is the only quantity of interest, but in most cases we can only estimate its distribution.\n",
    "2. FRE should never be used as a surrogate for TRE as the TRE for a specific registration is uncorrelated with its FRE [2]. \n",
    "3. TRE is spatially varying.\n",
    "4. A good TRE is dependent on using a good fiducial configuration [3].\n",
    "5. The least squares solution to paired-point registration is sensitive to outliers.\n",
