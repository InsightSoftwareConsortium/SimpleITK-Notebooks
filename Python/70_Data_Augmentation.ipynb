The problem being addressed is that the original dataset is not sufficiently representative of the general population of images. As a consequence, if we only train on the original dataset the resulting network will not generalize well to the population (overfitting). \n",

The reflection matrix is constructed using the plane, 3D,  or axis, 2D, which we want to reflect through with the standard basis vectors, $\\mathbf{e}_i, \\mathbf{e}_j$, and the remaining basis vector set to $-\\mathbf{e}_k$.  \n",

    "    * Reflection about $yz$ plane: $[-\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3]$.\n",
    "2. Use the native slicing operator(e.g. img[:,::-1,:]), or the FlipImageFilter after the image is resampled onto the reference image grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "We prefer option 1 as it is computationally more efficient. It combines all transformation prior to resampling, while the other approach performs resampling onto the reference image grid followed by the reflection operation. An additional difference is that using slicing or the FlipImageFilter will also modify the image origin while the resampling approach keeps the spatial location of the reference image origin intact. This minor difference is of no concern in deep learning as the content of the images is the same, but in SimpleITK two images are considered equivalent iff their content and spatial extent are the same.\n",

Case in point, using a 4D (3D+time) CT of the thorax we can estimate the respiratory motion using non-rigid registration and [Free Form Deformation](65_Registration_FFD.ipynb) or [displacement field](66_Registration_Demons.ipynb) transformations. We can then register a new spatial data set to the original spatial CT (non-rigidly) followed by application of the temporal deformations.\n",
