    "the use of three variants of this family of algorithms. The common theme for all algorithms is that a voxel's neighbor is considered to be in the same class if its intensities are similar to the current voxel. The definition of similar is what varies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>ConnectedThreshold</b>: The neighboring voxel's intensity is within explicitly specified thresholds.\n",
    "* <b>ConfidenceConnected</b>: The neighboring voxel's intensity is within the implicitly specified bounds $\\mu\\pm c\\sigma$, where $\\mu$ is the mean intensity of the seed points, $\\sigma$ their standard deviation and $c$ a user specified constant.\n",
    "* <b>VectorConfidenceConnected</b>: A generalization of the previous approach to vector valued images, for instance multi-spectral images or multi-parametric MRI. The neighboring voxel's intensity vector is within the implicitly specified bounds using the Mahalanobis distance $\\sqrt{(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{\\mu})^T\\Sigma^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{\\mu})}<c$, where $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ is the mean of the vectors at the seed points, $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix and $c$ is a user specified constant.\n",
