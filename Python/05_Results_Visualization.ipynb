    "In this notebook we illustrate various ways one can display the results of segmentation and registration algorithms so that they can be easily incorporated into a manuscript. For interactive data exploration we recommend using dedicated programs (e.g. 3D slicer). \n",
    "\n",
    "Two key points to remember when working with bio-medical images:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most often images have a high dynamic range. Thus, to write them to file in a format appropriate for use in a manuscript we will need to map the intensities to a low dynamic range (e.g. [0,255]). In SimpleITK this is readily done with the [IntensityWindowingImageFilter](https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1IntensityWindowingImageFilter.html).\n",
    "2. Images may have non-isotropic spacing between pixels. The file formats appropriate for use in a manuscript (e.g. png, jpg) assume isotropic pixel spacing. This requires that we resample the image before writing to disk. The function `make_isotropic` in the code cell bellow resolves this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following filters and their procedural counterparts are useful for various image creation tasks, as illustrated in this notebook:\n",
    " * [CastImageFilter](https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1CastImageFilter.html)\n",
    " * [ResampleImageFilter](https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1ResampleImageFilter.html), one of the more important filters in your toolbox, see [this notebook](21_Transforms_and_Resampling.ipynb) for additional usage details.\n",
    " * [TileImageFilter](https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1TileImageFilter.html)\n",
    " * [CheckerBoardImageFilter](https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1CheckerBoardImageFilter.html)\n",
