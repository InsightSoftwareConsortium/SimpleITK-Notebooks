    "<h1 align=\"center\">Registration: Memory-Time Trade-off</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing a registration algorithm or when selecting parameter value settings for an existing algorithm our choices are dictated by two, often opposing, constraints:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Required accuracy.</li>\n",
    "<li>Allotted time.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the goal of registration is to align multiple data elements into the same coordinate system, it is only natural that the primary focus is on accuracy. In most cases the reported accuracy is obtained without constraining the algorithm's execution time. Don't forget to provide the running times even if they are not critical for your particular application as they may be critical for others. \n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to the emphasis on execution time, on one end of the spectrum we have longitudinal studies where time constraints are relatively loose. In this setting a registration taking an hour may be perfectly acceptable. At the other end of the spectrum we have intra-operative registration. In this setting, registration is expected to complete within seconds or minutes. The  underlying reasons for the tight timing constraints in this setting have to do with the detrimental effects of prolonged anesthesia and with the increased costs of operating room time. While short execution times are important, simply completing the registration on time without sufficient accuracy is also unacceptable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates a straightforward approach for reducing the computational complexity of registration for intra-operative use via preprocessing and increased memory usage, a case of the [memory-time trade-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff). \n",
    "\n",
    "The computational cost of registration is primarily associated with interpolation, required for evaluating the similarity metric. Ideally we would like to use the fastest possible interpolation method, nearest neighbor. Unfortunately, nearest neighbor interpolation most often yields sub-optimal results. A straightforward solution is to pre-operatively create a super-sampled version of the moving-image using higher order interpolation*. We then perform registration using the super-sampled image, with nearest neighbor interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tallying up time and memory usage we see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr><td></td> <td><b>time</b></td><td><b>memory</b></td></tr>\n",
    "  <tr><td><b>pre-operative</b></td> <td>increase</td><td>increase</td></tr>\n",
    "  <tr><td><b>intra-operative</b></td> <td>decrease</td><td>increase</td></tr>\n",
    "</table><br><br>  \n",

    "<font size=\"-1\">*A better approach is to use single image super resolution techniques such as the one described in A. Rueda, N. Malpica, E. Romero,\"Single-image super-resolution of brain MR images using overcomplete dictionaries\", <i>Med Image Anal.</i>, 17(1):113-132, 2013.</font> \n"
