    "\n",
    "Evaluating segmentation algorithms is most often done using reference data to which you compare your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the medical domain reference data is commonly obtained via manual segmentation by an expert (don't forget to thank your clinical colleagues for their hard work). When you are resource limited, the reference data may be defined by a single expert. This is less than ideal. When multiple experts provide you with their input then you can potentially combine them to obtain reference data that is closer to the ever elusive \"ground truth\". In this notebook we show two approaches to combining input from multiple observers, majority vote and the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level\n",
    "Estimation [(STAPLE)](http://crl.med.harvard.edu/publications/warfield-staple-tmi-press-2004.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a reference, we compare the algorithm's performance using multiple criteria, as usually there is no single evaluation measure that conveys all of the relevant information. In this notebook we illustrate the use of the following evaluation criteria:\n",
    "* Overlap measures:\n",
    "  * overlap percentage\n",
    "  * jaccard and dice coefficients\n",
    "  * volume similarity \n",
    "  * false negative and false positive errors\n",
    "* Surface distance measures:\n",
    "  * Hausdorff distance (symmetric)\n",
    "  * Mean, median, max and standard deviation between surfaces\n",
    "  \n",
    "The data we use in the notebook is a set of manully segmented liver tumors from a single clinical CT scan. A larger dataset (four scans) is freely available from this [MIDAS repository](http://www.insight-journal.org/midas/collection/view/38). The relevant publication is: T. Popa et al., \"Tumor Volume Measurement and Volume Measurement Comparison Plug-ins for VolView Using ITK\", SPIE Medical Imaging: Visualization, Image-Guided Procedures, and Display, 2006.\n",

    "<b>Note</b>: The approach described here can also be used to evaluate Registration, as illustrated in the [free form deformation notebook](65_Registration_FFD.ipynb)."
