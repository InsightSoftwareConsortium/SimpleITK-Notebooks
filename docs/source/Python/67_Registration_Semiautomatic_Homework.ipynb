    "* Advantages: identification, coarse localization, of the landmarks or fiducials is extremely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics\">robust</a>. Humans readily identify salient features in the presence of noise and under a variety of spatial transformations, including large deformations.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Advantages: highly precise, and with a good coarse localization it is also highly accurate.\n",

Avoid the temptation to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting\">overfit</a>: When we only have pairs of manually localized points we may be tempted to use all of the point pairs and estimate a transformation that has more degrees of freedom. In our case, an affine transformation instead of a rigid one. To illustrate the problem with this approach you will manually localize four points in the two images. Estimate a rigid and an affine transformation using these points (change the transform type given as input to LandmarkBasedTransformInitializer).<br><br> \n",
